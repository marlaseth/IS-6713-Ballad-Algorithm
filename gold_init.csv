Lady of Shalott," Part I   On either side the river lie  Long fields of barley and of rye,  That clothe the wold and meet the sky;  And thro' the field the road runs by   To many-tower'd Camelot;  And up and down the people go,  Gazing where the lilies blow  Round an island there below,   The island of Shalott.  Willows whiten, aspens quiver,  Little breezes dusk and shiver  Thro' the wave that runs for ever  By the island in the river   Flowing down to Camelot.  Four gray walls, and four gray towers,  Overlook a space of flowers,  And the silent isle imbowers   The Lady of Shalott.  By the margin, willow veil'd,  Slide the heavy barges trail'd  By slow horses; and unhail'd  The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd   Skimming down to Camelot:  But who hath seen her wave her hand?  Or at the casement seen her stand?  Or is she known in all the land,   The Lady of Shalott?  Only reapers, reaping early  In among the bearded barley,  Hear a song that echoes cheerly  From the river winding clearly,   Down to tower'd Camelot:  And by the moon the reaper weary,  Piling sheaves in uplands airy,  Listening, whispers "" 'Tis the fairy   Lady of Shalott.""  Part II   There she weaves by night and day  A magic web with colours gay.  She has heard a whisper say,  A curse is on her if she stay   To look down to Camelot.  She knows not what the curse may be,  And so she weaveth steadily,  And little other care hath she,   The Lady of Shalott.  And moving thro' a mirror clear  That hangs before her all the year,  Shadows of the world appear.  There she sees the highway near   Winding down to Camelot:  There the river eddy whirls,  And there the surly village-churls,  And the red cloaks of market girls,   Pass onward from Shalott.  Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,  An abbot on an ambling pad,  Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,  Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,   Goes by to tower'd Camelot;  And sometimes thro' the mirror blue  The knights come riding two and two:  She hath no loyal knight and true,   The Lady of Shalott.  But in her web she still delights  To weave the mirror's magic sights,  For often thro' the silent nights  A funeral, with plumes and lights   And music, went to Camelot:  Or when the moon was overhead,  Came two young lovers lately wed:  ""I am half sick of shadows,"" said   The Lady of Shalott.  Part III   A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,  He rode between the barley-sheaves,  The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,  And flamed upon the brazen greaves   Of bold Sir Lancelot.  A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd  To a lady in his shield,  That sparkled on the yellow field,   Beside remote Shalott.  The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,  Like to some branch of stars we see  Hung in the golden Galaxy.  The bridle bells rang merrily   As he rode down to Camelot:  And from his blazon'd baldric slung  A mighty silver bugle hung,  And as he rode his armour rung,   Beside remote Shalott.  All in the blue unclouded weather  Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,  The helmet and the helmet-feather  Burn'd like one burning flame together,   As he rode down to Camelot.  As often thro' the purple night,  Below the starry clusters bright,  Some bearded meteor, trailing light,   Moves over still Shalott.  His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;  On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;  From underneath his helmet flow'd  His coal-black curls as on he rode,   As he rode down to Camelot.  From the bank and from the river  He flash'd into the crystal mirror,  ""Tirra lirra,"" by the river   Sang Sir Lancelot.  She left the web, she left the loom,  She made three paces thro' the room,  She saw the water-lily bloom,  She saw the helmet and the plume,   She look'd down to Camelot.  Out flew the web and floated wide;  The mirror crack'd from side to side;  ""The curse is come upon me,"" cried   The Lady of Shalott.  Part IV   In the stormy east-wind straining,  The pale yellow woods were waning,  The broad stream in his banks complaining,  Heavily the low sky raining   Over tower'd Camelot;  Down she came and found a boat  Beneath a willow left afloat,  And round about the prow she wrote    The Lady of Shalott.   And down the river's dim expanse  Like some bold seër in a trance,  Seeing all his own mischance—  With a glassy countenance   Did she look to Camelot.  And at the closing of the day  She loosed the chain, and down she lay;  The broad stream bore her far away,   The Lady of Shalott.  Lying, robed in snowy white  That loosely flew to left and right—  The leaves upon her falling light—  Thro' the noises of the night   She floated down to Camelot:  And as the boat-head wound along  The willowy hills and fields among,  They heard her singing her last song,   The Lady of Shalott.  Heard a carol, mournful, holy,  Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,  Till her blood was frozen slowly,  And her eyes were darken'd wholly,   Turn'd to tower'd Camelot.  For ere she reach'd upon the tide  The first house by the water-side,  Singing in her song she died,   The Lady of Shalott.  Under tower and balcony,  By garden-wall and gallery,  A gleaming shape she floated by,  Dead-pale between the houses high,   Silent into Camelot.  Out upon the wharfs they came,  Knight and burgher, lord and dame,  And round the prow they read her name,    The Lady of Shalott.   Who is this? and what is here?  And in the lighted palace near  Died the sound of royal cheer;  And they cross'd themselves for fear,   All the knights at Camelot:  But Lancelot mused a little space;  He said, ""She has a lovely face;  God in his mercy lend her grace,   The Lady of Shalott.""

The Raven," Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—  Only this and nothing more.”   Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.   Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow   From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  Nameless  here  for evermore.   And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating   “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—  This it is and nothing more.”   Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—  Darkness there and nothing more.   Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;   But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,   And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—  Merely this and nothing more.   Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.   “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—  ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”   Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;   Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—  Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”  Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”   Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,  With such name as “Nevermore.”   But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.   Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—   Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—  On the morrow  he  will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”  Then the bird said “Nevermore.”   Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore  Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”   But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;   Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore  Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”   This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;   This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining   On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,  But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,   She  shall press, ah, nevermore!   Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.   “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee   Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”  Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”   “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,   Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—   On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—  Is there— is  there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”  Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”   “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!  By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—   Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”  Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”   “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—  “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!   Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!   Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”  Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”   And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting,  still  is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,   And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor  Shall be lifted—nevermore!",ballad
Lady of the Lake: Boat Song," Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!  Honored and blessed be the ever-green Pine!  Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,  Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!  Heaven sent it happy dew,  Earth lend it sap anew,  Gayly to bourgeon and broadly to grow,  While every Highland glen  Sends our shout back again,  “Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!”  Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,  Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;  When the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain,  The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade.  Moored in the rifted rock,  Proof to the tempest’s shock,  Firmer he roots him the ruder it blow;  Menteith and Breadalbane, then,  Echo his praise again,  “Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!”  Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin,  And Bannochar’s groans to our slogan replied;  Glen-Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin,  And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on her side.  Widow and Saxon maid  Long shall lament our raid,  Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and with woe;  Lennox and Leven-glen  Shake when they hear again,  “Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!”  Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands!  Stretch to your oars for the ever-green Pine!  O that the rosebud that graces yon islands  Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!  O that some seedling gem,  Worthy such noble stem  Honored and blessed in their shadow might grow!  Loud should Clan-Alpine then  Ring from her deepmost glen,  “Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!”",ballad
After Apple-Picking," My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  Toward heaven still,  And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  Beside it, and there may be two or three  Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.  But I am done with apple-picking now.  Essence of winter sleep is on the night,  The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.  I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight  I got from looking through a pane of glass  I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough  And held against the world of hoary grass.  It melted, and I let it fall and break.  But I was well  Upon my way to sleep before it fell,  And I could tell  What form my dreaming was about to take.  Magnified apples appear and disappear,  Stem end and blossom end,  And every fleck of russet showing clear.  My instep arch not only keeps the ache,  It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.  I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.  And I keep hearing from the cellar bin  The rumbling sound  Of load on load of apples coming in.  For I have had too much  Of apple-picking: I am overtired  Of the great harvest I myself desired.  There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,  Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.  For all  That struck the earth,  No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,  Went surely to the cider-apple heap  As of no worth.  One can see what will trouble  This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.  Were he not gone,  The woodchuck could say whether it's like his  Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,  Or just some human sleep. ",not a ballad
Parting Song," First  it is one day without you. Then two. And soon, our point:  moot .  And our solution, diluted. And our class action (if ever was) is no longer suited. Wherewith I give to looting through the war chest of our past like a wily Anne Bonny  who snatches at plunder or graft.  But the wreck of that ransack, that strongbox, our splintering coffer, the claptrap bastard  of the best we had to offer, is sog-soaked and clammy,  empty but for sand.  Like the knuckle-white cup  of my urgent, ghastly hands in which nothing but  the ghost of love is held. Damn it to hell.",not a ballad
Fund Drive," She could be a Norman Rockwell painting,  the small girl on my front porch with her eager  face, her wind-burned cheeks red as cherries.  Her father waits by the curb, ready to rescue  his child should danger threaten, his shadow  reaching halfway across the yard. I take the  booklet from the girl's outstretched hand,  peruse the color photos of candy bars and  caramel-coated popcorn, pretend to read it.  I have no use for what she's selling, but I  can count the freckles on her nose, the scars  like fat worms on knobby knees that ought  to be covered on a cold day like this, when  the wind is blowing and the trees are losing  their grip on the last of their leaves.  I'll take two of these and one of those , I say, pointing,  thinking I won't eat them, but I probably will.  It's worth the coming calories to see her joy,  how hard she works to spell my name right,  taking down my  information . Then she turns  and gives a thumbs-up sign to her father, who  grins like an outfielder to whom the ball has  finally come—his heart like a glove, opening.",not a ballad
