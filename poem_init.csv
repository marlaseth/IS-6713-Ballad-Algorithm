The Hunting of the Snark," Fit the First   The Landing  ""Just the place for a Snark!"" the Bellman cried,  As he landed his crew with care;  Supporting each man on the top of the tide  By a finger entwined in his hair.  ""Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:  That alone should encourage the crew.  Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:  What I tell you three times is true.""  The crew was complete: it included a Boots—  A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—  And a Broker, to value their goods.  A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,  Might perhaps have won more than his share—  But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,  Had the whole of their cash in his care.  There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,  Or would sit making lace in the bow:  And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,  Though none of the sailors knew how.  There was one who was famed for the number of things  He forgot when he entered the ship:  His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,  And the clothes he had bought for the trip.  He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,  With his name painted clearly on each:  But, since he omitted to mention the fact,  They were all left behind on the beach.  The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because  He had seven coats on when he came,  With three pair of boots—but the worst of it was,  He had wholly forgotten his name.  He would answer to ""Hi!"" or to any loud cry,  Such as ""Fry me!"" or ""Fritter my wig!""  To ""What-you-may-call-um!"" or ""What-was-his-name!""  But especially ""Thing-um-a-jig!""  While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,  He had different names from these:  His intimate friends called him ""Candle-ends,""  And his enemies ""Toasted-cheese.""  ""His form is ungainly—his intellect small—""  (So the Bellman would often remark)  ""But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,  Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.""  He would joke with hænas, returning their stare  With an impudent wag of the head:  And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,  ""Just to keep up its spirits,"" he said.  He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—  And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—  He could only bake Bride-cake—for which, I may state,  No materials were to be had.  The last of the crew needs especial remark,  Though he looked an incredible dunce:  He had just one idea—but, that one being ""Snark,""  The good Bellman engaged him at once.  He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,  When the ship had been sailing a week,  He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,  And was almost too frightened to speak:  But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,  There was only one Beaver on board;  And that was a tame one he had of his own,  Whose death would be deeply deplored.  The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,  Protested, with tears in its eyes,  That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark  Could atone for that dismal surprise!  It strongly advised that the Butcher should be  Conveyed in a separate ship:  But the Bellman declared that would never agree  With the plans he had made for the trip:  Navigation was always a difficult art,  Though with only one ship and one bell:  And he feared he must really decline, for his part,  Undertaking another as well.  The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure  A second-hand dagger-proof coat—  So the Baker advised it—and next, to insure  Its life in some Office of note:  This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire  (On moderate terms), or for sale,  Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,  And one Against Damage From Hail.  Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,  Whenever the Butcher was by,  The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,  And appeared unaccountably shy.   Fit the Second    The Bellman's Speech  The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies—  Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!  Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,  The moment one looked in his face!  He had bought a large map representing the sea,  Without the least vestige of land:  And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be  A map they could all understand.  ""What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,  Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?""  So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply  ""They are merely conventional signs!  ""Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!  But we've got our brave Captain to thank  (So the crew would protest) ""that he's bought  us  the best—  A perfect and absolute blank!""  This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out  That the Captain they trusted so well  Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,  And that was to tingle his bell.  He was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave  Were enough to bewilder a crew.  When he cried ""Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!""  What on earth was the helmsman to do?  Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:  A thing, as the Bellman remarked,  That frequently happens in tropical climes,  When a vessel is, so to speak, ""snarked.""  But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,  And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,  Said he  had  hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,  That the ship would  not  travel due West!  But the danger was past—they had landed at last,  With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:  Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,  Which consisted of chasms and crags.  The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,  And repeated in musical tone  Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe—  But the crew would do nothing but groan.  He served out some grog with a liberal hand,  And bade them sit down on the beach:  And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,  As he stood and delivered his speech.  ""Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!""  (They were all of them fond of quotations:  So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,  While he served out additional rations).  ""We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,  (Four weeks to the month you may mark),  But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)  Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!  ""We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,  (Seven days to the week I allow),  But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,  We have never beheld till now!  ""Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again  The five unmistakable marks  By which you may know, wheresoever you go,  The warranted genuine Snarks.  ""Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,  Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:  Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,  With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.  ""Its habit of getting up late you'll agree  That it carries too far, when I say  That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,  And dines on the following day.  ""The third is its slowness in taking a jest.  Should you happen to venture on one,  It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:  And it always looks grave at a pun.  ""The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,  Which it constantly carries about,  And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes—  A sentiment open to doubt.  ""The fifth is ambition. It next will be right  To describe each particular batch:  Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,  From those that have whiskers, and scratch.  ""For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,  Yet, I feel it my duty to say,  Some are Boojums—"" The Bellman broke off in alarm,  For the Baker had fainted away.   Fit the Third   The Baker's Tale  They roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice—  They roused him with mustard and cress—  They roused him with jam and judicious advice—  They set him conundrums to guess.  When at length he sat up and was able to speak,  His sad story he offered to tell;  And the Bellman cried ""Silence! Not even a shriek!""  And excitedly tingled his bell.  There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,  Scarcely even a howl or a groan,  As the man they called ""Ho!"" told his story of woe  In an antediluvian tone.  ""My father and mother were honest, though poor—""  ""Skip all that!"" cried the Bellman in haste.  ""If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark—  We have hardly a minute to waste!""  ""I skip forty years,"" said the Baker, in tears,  ""And proceed without further remark  To the day when you took me aboard of your ship  To help you in hunting the Snark.  ""A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)  Remarked, when I bade him farewell—""  ""Oh, skip your dear uncle!"" the Bellman exclaimed,  As he angrily tingled his bell.  ""He remarked to me then,"" said that mildest of men,  ""'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:  Fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens,  And it's handy for striking a light.  ""'You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care;  You may hunt it with forks and hope;  You may threaten its life with a railway-share;  You may charm it with smiles and soap—'""  (""That's exactly the method,"" the Bellman bold  In a hasty parenthesis cried,  ""That's exactly the way I have always been told  That the capture of Snarks should be tried!"")  ""'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,  If your Snark be a Boojum! For then  You will softly and suddenly vanish away,  And never be met with again!'  ""It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,  When I think of my uncle's last words:  And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl  Brimming over with quivering curds!  ""It is this, it is this—"" ""We have had that before!""  The Bellman indignantly said.  And the Baker replied ""Let me say it once more.  It is this, it is this that I dread!  ""I engage with the Snark—every night after dark—  In a dreamy delirious fight:  I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,  And I use it for striking a light:  ""But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,  In a moment (of this I am sure),  I shall softly and suddenly vanish away—  And the notion I cannot endure!""   Fit the Fourth   The Hunting  The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.  ""If only you'd spoken before!  It's excessively awkward to mention it now,  With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!  ""We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,  If you never were met with again—  But surely, my man, when the voyage began,  You might have suggested it then?  ""It's excessively awkward to mention it now—  As I think I've already remarked.""  And the man they called ""Hi!"" replied, with a sigh,  ""I informed you the day we embarked.  ""You may charge me with murder—or want of sense—  (We are all of us weak at times):  But the slightest approach to a false pretence  Was never among my crimes!  ""I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch—  I said it in German and Greek:  But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)  That English is what you speak!""  ""'Tis a pitiful tale,"" said the Bellman, whose face  Had grown longer at every word:  ""But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,  More debate would be simply absurd.  ""The rest of my speech"" (he explained to his men)  ""You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.  But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!  'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!  ""To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;  To pursue it with forks and hope;  To threaten its life with a railway-share;  To charm it with smiles and soap!  ""For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't  Be caught in a commonplace way.  Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:  Not a chance must be wasted to-day!  ""For England expects—I forbear to proceed:  'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:  And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need  To rig yourselves out for the fight.""  Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed),  And changed his loose silver for notes.  The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,  And shook the dust out of his coats.  The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade—  Each working the grindstone in turn:  But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed  No interest in the concern:  Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,  And vainly proceeded to cite  A number of cases, in which making laces  Had been proved an infringement of right.  The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned  A novel arrangement of bows:  While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand  Was chalking the tip of his nose.  But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,  With yellow kid gloves and a ruff—  Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,  Which the Bellman declared was all ""stuff.""  ""Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,"" he said,  ""If we happen to meet it together!""  And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,  Said ""That must depend on the weather.""  The Beaver went simply galumphing about,  At seeing the Butcher so shy:  And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,  Made an effort to wink with one eye.  ""Be a man!"" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard  The Butcher beginning to sob.  ""Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,  We shall need all our strength for the job!""    Fit the Fifth   The Beaver's Lesson  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  They pursued it with forks and hope;  They threatened its life with a railway-share;  They charmed it with smiles and soap.  Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan  For making a separate sally;  And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,  A dismal and desolate valley.  But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:  It had chosen the very same place:  Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,  The disgust that appeared in his face.  Each thought he was thinking of nothing but ""Snark""  And the glorious work of the day;  And each tried to pretend that he did not remark  That the other was going that way.  But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,  And the evening got darker and colder,  Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)  They marched along shoulder to shoulder.  Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,  And they knew that some danger was near:  The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,  And even the Butcher felt queer.  He thought of his childhood, left far far behind—  That blissful and innocent state—  The sound so exactly recalled to his mind  A pencil that squeaks on a slate!  ""'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!"" he suddenly cried.  (This man, that they used to call ""Dunce."")  ""As the Bellman would tell you,"" he added with pride,  ""I have uttered that sentiment once.  ""'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;  You will find I have told it you twice.  Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,  If only I've stated it thrice.""  The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,  Attending to every word:  But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,  When the third repetition occurred.  It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,  It had somehow contrived to lose count,  And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains  By reckoning up the amount.  ""Two added to one—if that could but be done,""  It said, ""with one's fingers and thumbs!""  Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,  It had taken no pains with its sums.  ""The thing can be done,"" said the Butcher, ""I think.  The thing must be done, I am sure.  The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,  The best there is time to procure.""  The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,  And ink in unfailing supplies:  While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,  And watched them with wondering eyes.  So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,  As he wrote with a pen in each hand,  And explained all the while in a popular style  Which the Beaver could well understand.  ""Taking Three as the subject to reason about—  A convenient number to state—  We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out  By One Thousand diminished by Eight.  ""The result we proceed to divide, as you see,  By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:  Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be  Exactly and perfectly true.  ""The method employed I would gladly explain,  While I have it so clear in my head,  If I had but the time and you had but the brain—  But much yet remains to be said.  ""In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been  Enveloped in absolute mystery,  And without extra charge I will give you at large  A Lesson in Natural History.""  In his genial way he proceeded to say  (Forgetting all laws of propriety,  And that giving instruction, without introduction,  Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),  ""As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,  Since it lives in perpetual passion:  Its taste in costume is entirely absurd—  It is ages ahead of the fashion:  ""But it knows any friend it has met once before:  It never will look at a bribe:  And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,  And collects—though it does not subscribe.  ""Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far  Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:  (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,  And some, in mahogany kegs:)  ""You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:  You condense it with locusts and tape:  Still keeping one principal object in view—  To preserve its symmetrical shape.""  The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,  But he felt that the Lesson must end,  And he wept with delight in attempting to say  He considered the Beaver his friend.  While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks  More eloquent even than tears,  It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books  Would have taught it in seventy years.  They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned  (For a moment) with noble emotion,  Said ""This amply repays all the wearisome days  We have spent on the billowy ocean!""  Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,  Have seldom if ever been known;  In winter or summer, 'twas always the same—  You could never meet either alone.  And when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds  Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour—  The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,  And cemented their friendship for ever!   Fit the Sixth   The Barrister's Dream  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  They pursued it with forks and hope;  They threatened its life with a railway-share;  They charmed it with smiles and soap.  But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain  That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,  Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain  That his fancy had dwelt on so long.  He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,  Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,  Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig  On the charge of deserting its sty.  The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,  That the sty was deserted when found:  And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law  In a soft under-current of sound.  The indictment had never been clearly expressed,  And it seemed that the Snark had begun,  And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed  What the pig was supposed to have done.  The Jury had each formed a different view  (Long before the indictment was read),  And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew  One word that the others had said.  ""You must know—"" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed ""Fudge!""  That statute is obsolete quite!  Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends  On an ancient manorial right.  ""In the matter of Treason the pig would appear  To have aided, but scarcely abetted:  While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,  If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'  ""The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;  But its guilt, as I trust, is removed  (So far as relates to the costs of this suit)  By the Alibi which has been proved.  ""My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.""  Here the speaker sat down in his place,  And directed the Judge to refer to his notes  And briefly to sum up the case.  But the Judge said he never had summed up before;  So the Snark undertook it instead,  And summed it so well that it came to far more  Than the Witnesses ever had said!  When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,  As the word was so puzzling to spell;  But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind  Undertaking that duty as well.  So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,  It was spent with the toils of the day:  When it said the word ""GUILTY!"" the Jury all groaned,  And some of them fainted away.  Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite  Too nervous to utter a word:  When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,  And the fall of a pin might be heard.  ""Transportation for life"" was the sentence it gave,  ""And  then  to be fined forty pound.""  The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared  That the phrase was not legally sound.  But their wild exultation was suddenly checked  When the jailer informed them, with tears,  Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,  As the pig had been dead for some years.  The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:  But the Snark, though a little aghast,  As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,  Went bellowing on to the last.  Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed  To grow every moment more clear:  Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,  Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.   Fit the Seventh   The Banker's Fate  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  They pursued it with forks and hope;  They threatened its life with a railway-share;  They charmed it with smiles and soap.  And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new  It was matter for general remark,  Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view  In his zeal to discover the Snark  But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,  A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh  And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,  For he knew it was useless to fly.  He offered large discount—he offered a cheque  (Drawn ""to bearer"") for seven-pounds-ten:  But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck  And grabbed at the Banker again.  Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws  Went savagely snapping around—  He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,  Till fainting he fell to the ground.  The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared  Led on by that fear-stricken yell:  And the Bellman remarked ""It is just as I feared!""  And solemnly tolled on his bell.  He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace  The least likeness to what he had been:  While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white—  A wonderful thing to be seen!  To the horror of all who were present that day,  He uprose in full evening dress,  And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say  What his tongue could no longer express.  Down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair—  And chanted in mimsiest tones  Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,  While he rattled a couple of bones.  ""Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!""  The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.  ""We have lost half the day. Any further delay,  And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!""   Fit the Eighth   The Vanishing  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;  They pursued it with forks and hope;  They threatened its life with a railway-share;  They charmed it with smiles and soap.  They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,  And the Beaver, excited at last,  Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,  For the daylight was nearly past.  ""There is Thingumbob shouting!"" the Bellman said,  ""He is shouting like mad, only hark!  He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,  He has certainly found a Snark!""  They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed  ""He was always a desperate wag!""  They beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed—  On the top of a neighbouring crag,  Erect and sublime, for one moment of time,  In the next, that wild figure they saw  (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,  While they waited and listened in awe.  ""It's a Snark!"" was the sound that first came to their ears,  And seemed almost too good to be true.  Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:  Then the ominous words ""It's a Boo—""  Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air  A weary and wandering sigh  That sounded like ""-jum!"" but the others declare  It was only a breeze that went by.  They hunted till darkness came on, but they found  Not a button, or feather, or mark,  By which they could tell that they stood on the ground  Where the Baker had met with the Snark.  In the midst of the word he was trying to say,  In the midst of his laughter and glee,  He had softly and suddenly vanished away—  For the Snark  was  a Boojum, you see.",ballad
Casey at the bat," A Ballad of the Republic, Sung in the Year 1888 The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;  The score stood four to two with but one inning more to play.  And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,  A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.  A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest  Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;  They thought if only Casey could but get a whack at that—  We’d put up even money now with Casey at the bat.  But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,  And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;  So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,  For there seemed but little chance of Casey’s getting to the bat.  But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,  And Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;  And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,  There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.  Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell;  It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;  It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,  For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.  There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;  There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile on Casey’s face.  And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,  No stranger in the crowd could doubt ’twas Casey at the bat.  Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;  Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.  Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,  Defiance gleamed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.  And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,  And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.  Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—  “That ain’t my style,” said Casey. “Strike one,” the umpire said.  From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,  Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.  “Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted some one on the stand;  And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.  With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;  He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;  He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;  But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, “Strike two.”  “Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered fraud;  But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.  They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,  And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.  The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clinched in hate;  He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.  And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,  And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.  Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;  The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,  And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;  But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.",ballad
Annabel Lee," It was many and many a year ago,  In a kingdom by the sea,  That a maiden there lived whom you may know  By the name of Annabel Lee;  And this maiden she lived with no other thought  Than to love and be loved by me.  I  was a child and  she  was a child,  In this kingdom by the sea,  But we loved with a love that was more than love—  I and my Annabel Lee—  With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven  Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,  In this kingdom by the sea,  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling  My beautiful Annabel Lee;  So that her highborn kinsmen came  And bore her away from me,  To shut her up in a sepulchre  In this kingdom by the sea.  The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,  Went envying her and me—  Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,  In this kingdom by the sea)  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love  Of those who were older than we—  Of many far wiser than we—  And neither the angels in Heaven above  Nor the demons down under the sea  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side  Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,  In her sepulchre there by the sea—  In her tomb by the sounding sea.",not a ballad
The Best Game the Fairies Play," The best game the fairies play,   The best game of all,  Is sliding down steeples—   (You know they’re very tall).  You fly to the weathercock,   And when you hear it crow,  You fold your wings and clutch your things   And then let go!  They have a million other games—   Cloud-catching’s one,  And mud-mixing after rain   Is heaps and heaps of fun;  But when you go and stay with them   Never mind the rest,  Take my advice—they’re very nice,   But steeple-sliding’s best!",not a ballad
The Cremation of Sam McGee," There are strange things done in the midnight sun   By the men who moil for gold; The Arctic trails have their secret tales   That would make your blood run cold; The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,   But the queerest they ever did see Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge   I cremated Sam McGee.  Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.  Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.  He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;  Though he'd often say in his homely way that ""he'd sooner live in hell.""  On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.  Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.  If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;  It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.  And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,  And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,  He turned to me, and ""Cap,"" says he, ""I'll cash in this trip, I guess;  And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.""  Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:  ""It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.  Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;  So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.""  A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;  And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.  He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;  And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.  There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,  With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;  It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: ""You may tax your brawn and brains,  But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains.""  Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.  In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.  In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,  Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed the thing.  And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;  And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;  The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;  And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.  Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;  It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the ""Alice May.""  And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;  Then ""Here,"" said I, with a sudden cry, ""is my cre-ma-tor-eum.""  Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;  Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;  The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see;  And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.  Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;  And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.  It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;  And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.  I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;  But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;  I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: ""I'll just take a peep inside.  I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked""; ... then the door I opened wide.  And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;  And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: ""Please close that door.  It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—  Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."" There are strange things done in the midnight sun   By the men who moil for gold; The Arctic trails have their secret tales   That would make your blood run cold; The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,   But the queerest they ever did see Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge   I cremated Sam McGee.",ballad

The Highwayman," P ART  O NE  The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.  The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.  The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,  And the highwayman came riding—  Riding—riding—  The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.  He’d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,  A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin.  They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh.  And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,  His pistol butts a-twinkle,  His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard.  He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.  He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there  But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,  Bess, the landlord’s daughter,  Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.  And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked  Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and peaked.  His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,  But he loved the landlord’s daughter,  The landlord’s red-lipped daughter.  Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—  “One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I’m after a prize to-night,  But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;  Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,  Then look for me by moonlight,  Watch for me by moonlight,  I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”  He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her hand,  But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a brand  As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;  And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,  (O, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)  Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.  P ART  T WO  He did not come in the dawning. He did not come at noon;  And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon,  When the road was a gypsy’s ribbon, looping the purple moor,  A red-coat troop came marching—  Marching—marching—  King George’s men came marching, up to the old inn-door.  They said no word to the landlord. They drank his ale instead.  But they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow bed.  Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!  There was death at every window;  And hell at one dark window;  For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that  he  would ride.  They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest.  They had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her breast!  “Now, keep good watch!” and they kissed her. She heard the doomed man say— Look for me by moonlight;   Watch for me by moonlight; I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!  She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!  She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!  They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years  Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,  Cold, on the stroke of midnight,  The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!  The tip of one finger touched it. She strove no more for the rest.  Up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her breast.  She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;  For the road lay bare in the moonlight;  Blank and bare in the moonlight;  And the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love’s refrain. Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot!  Had they heard it? The horsehoofs ringing clear; Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot,  in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?  Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,  The highwayman came riding—  Riding—riding—  The red coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still. Tlot-tlot , in the frosty silence!  Tlot-tlot , in the echoing night!  Nearer he came and nearer. Her face was like a light.  Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,  Then her finger moved in the moonlight,  Her musket shattered the moonlight,  Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  He turned. He spurred to the west; he did not know who stood  Bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood!  Not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear  How Bess, the landlord’s daughter,  The landlord’s black-eyed daughter,  Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,  With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high.  Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat;  When they shot him down on the highway,  Down like a dog on the highway,  And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  . . . And still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,  When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,  When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,  A highwayman comes riding—  Riding—riding—  A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard.  He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.  He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there  But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,  Bess, the landlord’s daughter,  Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.",ballad

Jabberwocky," ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  All mimsy were the borogoves,  And the mome raths outgrabe.  “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  The frumious Bandersnatch!”  He took his vorpal sword in hand;  Long time the manxome foe he sought—  So rested he by the Tumtum tree  And stood awhile in thought.  And, as in uffish thought he stood,  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,  Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,  And burbled as it came!  One, two! One, two! And through and through  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  He left it dead, and with its head  He went galumphing back.  “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!  O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”  He chortled in his joy.  ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  All mimsy were the borogoves,  And the mome raths outgrabe.",ballad
John Henry," When John Henry was a little tiny baby  Sitting on his mama's knee,  He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel  Saying, ""Hammer's going to be the death of me, Lord, Lord,   Hammer's going to be the death of me.""  John Henry was a man just six feet high,  Nearly two feet and a half across his breast.  He'd hammer with a nine-pound hammer all day  And never get tired and want to rest, Lord, Lord,   And never get tired and want to rest.  John Henry went up on the mountain  And he looked one eye straight up its side.  The mountain was so tall and John Henry was so small,  He laid down his hammer and he cried, ""Lord, Lord,""   He laid down his hammer and he cried.  John Henry said to his captain,  ""Captain, you go to town,  Bring me back a TWELVE-pound hammer, please,  And I'll beat that steam drill down, Lord, Lord,   I'll beat that steam drill down.""  The captain said to John Henry,  ""I believe this mountain's sinking in.""  But John Henry said, ""Captain, just you stand aside--  It's nothing but my hammer catching wind, Lord, Lord,   It's nothing but my hammer catching wind.""  John Henry said to his shaker,  ""Shaker, boy, you better start to pray,  'Cause if my TWELVE-pound hammer miss that little piece of steel,  Tomorrow'll be your burying day, Lord, Lord,   Tomorrow'll be your burying day.""  John Henry said to his captain,  ""A man is nothing but a man,  But before I let your steam drill beat me down,  I'd die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord,   I'd die with a hammer in my hand.""  The man that invented the steam drill,  He figured he was mighty high and fine,  But John Henry sunk the steel down fourteen feet  While the steam drill only made nine, Lord, Lord,   The steam drill only made nine.  John Henry hammered on the right-hand side.  Steam drill kept driving on the left.  John Henry beat that steam drill down.  But he hammered his poor heart to death, Lord, Lord,   He hammered his poor heart to death.  Well, they carried John Henry down the tunnel  And they laid his body in the sand.  Now every woman riding on a C and O train  Says, ""There lies my steel-driving man, Lord, Lord,   There lies my steel-driving man.""",ballad

Mr. Nobody," I know a funny little man,   As quiet as a mouse,  Who does the mischief that is done   In everybody’s house!  There’s no one ever sees his face,   And yet we all agree  That every plate we break was cracked   By Mr. Nobody.  ’Tis he who always tears out books,   Who leaves the door ajar,  He pulls the buttons from our shirts,   And scatters pins afar;  That squeaking door will always squeak,   For prithee, don’t you see,  We leave the oiling to be done   By Mr. Nobody.  He puts damp wood upon the fire  That kettles cannot boil; His are the feet that bring in mud,  And all the carpets soil. The papers always are mislaid;  Who had them last, but he? There’s no one tosses them about  But Mr. Nobody. The finger marks upon the door   By none of us are made;  We never leave the blinds unclosed,   To let the curtains fade.  The ink we never spill;the boots   That lying round you see  Are not our boots,—they all belong   To Mr. Nobody.",not a ballad
The Owl and the Pussy Cat," I  The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea  In a beautiful pea-green boat,  They took some honey, and plenty of money,  Wrapped up in a five-pound note.  The Owl looked up to the stars above,  And sang to a small guitar,  ""O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,   What a beautiful Pussy you are,  You are,  You are!  What a beautiful Pussy you are!""  II  Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl!  How charmingly sweet you sing!  O let us be married! too long we have tarried:  But what shall we do for a ring?""  They sailed away, for a year and a day,  To the land where the Bong-Tree grows  And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood  With a ring at the end of his nose,   His nose,   His nose,  With a ring at the end of his nose.  III  ""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling  Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""  So they took it away, and were married next day  By the Turkey who lives on the hill.  They dined on mince, and slices of quince,  Which they ate with a runcible spoon;   And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,  They danced by the light of the moon,   The moon,   The moon,  They danced by the light of the moon.",ballad

Pumberly Pott’s Unpredictable Niece," Pumberly Pott’s unpredictable niece  declared with her usual zeal  that she would devour, by piece after piece,  her uncle’s new automobile.  She set to her task very early one morn  by consuming the whole carburetor;  then she swallowed the windshield, the headlights and horn,  and the steering wheel just a bit later.  She chomped on the doors, on the handles and locks,  on the valves and the pistons and rings;  on the air pump and fuel pump and spark plugs and shocks,  on the brakes and the axles and springs.  When her uncle arrived she was chewing a hash  made of leftover hoses and wires  (she’d just finished eating the clutch and the dash  and the steel-belted radial tires).  “Oh, what have you done to my auto,” he cried,  “you strange unpredictable lass?”  “The thing won’t work, Uncle Pott,” she replied,  and he wept, “It was just out of gas.”",not a ballad

So We’ll Go No More a Roving," So, we'll go no more a roving  So late into the night,  Though the heart be still as loving,  And the moon be still as bright.
